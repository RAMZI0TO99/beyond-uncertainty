# PROJECT STATE — *Beyond Uncertainty*

**Bachelor's thesis · Diagnosing When Embodied World Models Need More Data or a Different Model**

This is the shared working file for the project. It is written by Claude, reviewed by Sol, and carried between sessions by the student. **It travels with `DECISIONS.md`** — the decisions ledger moved there when this file outgrew its paste cap (D-037), and §3 below indexes it. If a fact about this project is not in one of the two, it does not survive the end of a Claude session.

**The memory asymmetry — read this before anything else.** Sol runs in one continuous session and never forgets. Claude is closed and reopened repeatedly and starts each session blank. This file exists primarily so **Claude can reconstruct** what Sol simply remembers. Two consequences:

- Claude reads this file **first, in full**, at the start of every session — before touching code, before answering anything.
- Sol is **not** re-fed the whole file each time. Sol gets `DELTA_TO_SOL.md`. Re-pasting everything wastes the student's effort and buries new information in text Sol already has.

**Corollary — Sol is the continuity check on Claude.** If Claude returns after a reset and contradicts something settled weeks ago, Sol is the one who will notice. That is a real duty, not a courtesy.

**Paste rule.** This file must stay small enough to paste into a chat window. Target ≤ 500 lines. When §7 grows past that, move closed phases to `PROJECT_STATE_ARCHIVE.md` and leave a one-line pointer. Never let this file become the thing nobody reads.

**Source of truth.** The two plan documents are authoritative for *design*; this file is authoritative for *state*. Where they conflict on design, the plan wins and the conflict goes in §4 as a deviation. This file never silently overrides the plan.

- Claude's operational handoff, read first at session start: `CLAUDE.md`
- Plan: `docs/thesis_project_plan_v1_2.docx` (v1.2, design frozen) — cited below as **P§n**
- Schedule: `docs/thesis_day_by_day_schedule_v1_2.docx` (v1.2, 20 weeks) — cited below as **S§Wn**

## 0. How to use this file

**Claude — session start.** Before anything else, including for a question that looks trivial: read this file in full, then `DECISIONS.md` (§1 where you are, §2 what you may not change, §3's index points into the ledger, §4–§5 deviations and gates); check §1's *Last updated* against today and say so if it is over a week stale — a stale snapshot is how a reset agent confidently redoes finished work; check §6 for anything Sol asked for that is unactioned; then tell the student in two lines where things stand and what you think is next, and wait.

**Claude — session end.** (1) Rewrite §1 so it is true now. (2) Append a §7 session-log entry. (3) Append any new §3 decisions, §4 deviations, §5 gate records. (4) Update `DELTA_TO_SOL.md` — append if undelivered, replace only once delivered (D-008, D-023), naming the session under `COVERS SESSIONS`; it is the only channel through which Sol learns anything. (5) Run the suite: `tests/test_project_state.py` enforces (1)–(4) mechanically (D-022), and if it fails, **fix the file, not the test**. From the first real result onward every delta reporting one carries a `NUMBERS` block (D-011): unit counts including `min(N₀, N₁)`, seeds and policy, point estimate, interval *and what it was taken over*, ambiguous and undiagnosed counts, and which test ran — prose alone leaves Sol unable to audit anything, which is the same as having no reviewer.

**Never edit a past entry in §3, §4, §5 or §7.** Corrections are new entries referencing the old one. §1 and §8 are the only sections that get overwritten.

**Sol.** Onboarded once with `SOL_BRIEF.md` and this file in full, then continuous; thereafter receives only `DELTA_TO_SOL.md`. Returns verdict blocks in the brief's format and does not rewrite this file — the student pastes them back and Claude files them into §6 or §3. If Sol's session is ever lost, re-onboard with `SOL_BRIEF.md` + this whole file, saying explicitly that it follows a session loss.

**Student.** To Sol: `DELTA_TO_SOL.md` only (first time or after a Sol session loss: `SOL_BRIEF.md` + this whole file). To Claude: the whole file at every session start, then Sol's verdict blocks as they arrive. Keep this file in version control so its own history is diffable.

## 1. Snapshot — *rewritten each session, always current*

| | |
|---|---|
| **Last updated** | 2026-08-17 |
| **Updated by** | Claude |
| **Phase** | Phase A — infrastructure |
| **Current week / day** | **Weeks 1–2 audited; W3 Mon–Wed CERTIFIED at `2875e60`; W3 audited (D-060), closed out (D-061 … D-063), corrected (D-064) and RNG-corrected (D-065).** Twelve Sol reviews actioned. Sol has accepted every scientific item — `rows.json` independently checked, D-061/C-010, D-063, device derivation, mixed-accelerator refusal — and holds certification on **one narrow code item**, now fixed. Week 1 Monday is **today** — roughly two weeks ahead of calendar (DEV-002) |
| **Next gate** | **Gate 1**, Week 5 Saturday = **2026-09-19** |
| **Repository** | [`RAMZI0TO99/beyond-uncertainty`](https://github.com/RAMZI0TO99/beyond-uncertainty) — **private**. See *Revision* row for the exact state |
| **Revision** | `main` — HEAD at the end of §7's latest entry, tree **clean**. **Certified base: still `2875e60`.** Sol reviewed `0b09f84` and did **not** certify it — Week 3 stays open until the closeout bundle passes. Set `BASE=2875e60` |
| **Tests** | **442 passing, 2 skipped** (CUDA tests run only where a device exists; the two-GPU test skips on this machine and is declared unverified) (the CUDA test runs only where a device exists). Includes golden `unit_id` values, the Experiment 2A aliasing property, D-030's stream pairing, gradient isolation between the heads, and — new — that MC-dropout samples actually **vary** and that a second pilot run cannot touch the first one's evidence |
| **Compute used** | **0 GPU-hours** of ~110–145 budgeted (trigger ≈ 120, P§14.3). Every fit so far ran on **CPU**. Two sub-second GPU tests now run in the suite (~68 MiB) to cover the CUDA RNG fork and seeding — the student's other workload has finished and the card is at ~0.9/16 GB |
| **Design scale** | 300 units (the statistical unit) in **240 comparison groups** · unit-level class balance **150/150**, group counts 125/115 · **8,197 model fits** vs P§14.2's ~8,700 |

**Hypothesis status**

| | Claim | Status | Decided at |
|---|---|---|---|
| H1 | Ensemble disagreement tracks estimation failure | Not tested | Gate check W4, verdict W10 Mon |
| H2 | Disagreement-to-error ratio is low under hypothesis-class failure | Not tested | W10 Tue → **Gate 2** |
| H3 | Learned critic beats fitted (error, disagreement) rule by > 5 pts | Not tested | W15 Fri |

**Done — Weeks 1 and 2, every "Done when" criterion verified rather than asserted.**
Detail is in `PROJECT_STATE_ARCHIVE.md` §7 and in the decisions below.
- **Week 1** — repo, `constants.py` (D-005), config and three identities (D-006), run records, JSONL logging, gridworld, masking encoder. Audited: seven defects (D-015), version bump under a Change Record (D-016).
- **Week 2** — confound parameter, enumerator (D-018), scripted policy and collector with coverage evidence (D-020), both prose cells drafted (D-019, awaiting the student's rewrite). Audited: six defects (D-021).
- **Sol's earlier rulings implemented** — identity registry (D-009), `stage` in run identity (D-012), critic whitelist frozen (D-013).
- **All eight of Sol's 2026-08-16 reviews actioned in full** (D-025 … D-057). Every verdict was CHALLENGED; every finding was independently verified before anything changed, and every one stood. The second found 375 fits of phantom compute. The fourth and fifth were both about **my reasoning rather than the code**, on the same paragraph: a worst-case bound reported as a measurement (D-042), then two different estimands compared as if one approximated the other (D-044).
- **Week 3 Mon–Wed built** (D-046, D-049, D-050) and then **substantially corrected** across Sol's sixth, seventh and eighth reviews (D-051 … D-057). The correction is the important part: the behaviour policy was **non-stationary across episodes**, so dataset size was confounded with behaviour distribution; validation was carved from a nested prefix, so the held-out set was a function of dataset size *and* a "100-transition" condition trained on 50; and N=100 had one training episode, making its episode bootstrap degenerate. All three fixed and verified.
- **D-030's named streams are built** (`src/bu/streams.py`), verified on the pairing properties rather than merely present: Experiment 1's datasets are nested prefixes, 2A/2B levels share a group, units in **different comparison groups** are independent at equal seeds — units inside one group are correlated by design (D-039, corrected by D-042 and D-044). `arm` never affects stream identity; raw `stage` is absent from a key but can reach data-stream *derivation* via `comparison_stage`, which is why `execution_plan` verifies that every role merged into one fit resolves to identical streams (D-038).

**In flight:** nothing running. **No compute consumed.**

**Next actions — Week 3, the world model.**
0. **W3 Mon — DONE and Sol-ruled** (D-046, D-047, D-048). Criterion met across all five capacity levels and all four withholding configurations. Beyond it: blocked movement transitions carry **1.67×** the position error of free moves; `interact` is deterministic and predictable in every canonical condition (0 aliased successors) but aliased when position is withheld — a second mechanism behind D-026.
1. **W3 Tue — DONE** (D-049). Trains 5,000 transitions, early-stops at epoch 10 of 31 in 1.5s CPU, curve reaching `load_runs()`. Split by episode and **strided**, all of D-047's constraints implemented. Measured: a transition-level split is **4.5–8.7× optimistic**, worst at small n.
2. **W3 Wed — DONE** (D-050). Five members on 5,000 transitions in 8.0s CPU; per-member validation errors 0.0034–0.0061, sd 0.0010, each drawing ~50 of 80 training episodes. **Raised Q-011.**
3. **W3 Fri and Sat — DONE** (D-058, corrected by **D-059**). 90 fits on CPU, rerun with per-transition export. **Error falls monotonically in N; disagreement does not** — it peaks at N=250, direction reproduced in all three seeds paired (+0.179, +0.360, +0.102). Measured **per member**: at N=100 members range 0.219–0.639 of the target's variation, at N=250 0.220–0.836, at N=5,000 0.939–0.974. The mechanism is **heterogeneous contraction, not collapse** — disagreement peaks where the spread across members is widest. The lowest whole-pool ratio is at N=100 (0.462), but that is **not** the registered H2 ratio, which is defined over the failure set and needs the W4 Fri threshold.
4. **W3 closeout — DONE** (D-061, D-062, D-063), on Sol's review of deltas 27–28. Two serious findings, both verified first and **one of them different from how it was stated**: the MC-dropout fix restored state without re-enabling dropout (measured on a real dropout model: **exactly zero** disagreement under the old path), and the rerun hazard was reachable through a *different-scope* rerun rather than the append path, which `write_run_record` already blocked. Scale ruling adopted and the pilot's numbers reproduce **exactly**. No second trunk.
5. **W4 Mon — NEXT, once the closeout bundle passes review.** The rank-correlation trend test, used for both the W4 gate and the W10 H1 verdict. **Read it knowing the disagreement curve is non-monotone at the small end** — a rank correlation over the six sizes is exactly the instrument that non-monotonicity bends. Sol has blocked W4 confirmatory work until the closeout is reviewed.

**No open questions.** Q-011 closed by D-053 (episode bootstrap primary). Q-010 closed by D-047: the auxiliary head is detached, both losses are action-conditional, and three unrecorded result-affecting knobs are gone. Position loss improved 0.002242 → 0.000931 at the same budget. **D-047's open item is closed** by D-063: the real loop never closed the gap at any size or member, Sol ruled against a second trunk, and the detached head is now a **non-decisional diagnostic** — barred from the trunk, from early stopping and checkpoint selection, from the failure set, from repair labels and from the critic's residual.

**Blocked on:** **W4 confirmatory work, until the closeout bundle passes review** — Sol's condition, and the right one: the MC-dropout mechanism is a rung-3 dependency of the W4 gate itself. Still blocked, correctly: **confirmatory execution** and **repair validation**, both waiting on the confirmatory runner; **critic splitting** and **W5 MDE approval** — see C-003, C-005, C-006, C-008, C-009. No open questions.

**Standing watch — Sol's tripwire on D-001.** Sol endorsed the role split conditionally, and DEV-005 was a hit against that condition. Sol weighed it on 2026-08-16 and **kept the split**, on the grounds that the mechanised protocol tests improve the arrangement more than reassigning implementation would. The watch stays live: consequential design decisions go into a delta **and get delivered** before dependent code is built on them, and Claude flags any decision it believes meets that bar at the moment of making it. D-030 is the current test of that — decided, filed, and deliberately left unbuilt.

## 2. Frozen constants — *changing any of these requires a §3 Change Record and a Sol review*

These are the preregistered quantities. They are fixed **before** data collection and are not revised after seeing data. Their whole purpose is to be un-adjustable later.

| Constant | Value | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Data-repair budget | **10×** the failure-condition dataset, same generating process | P§7.2 |
| Repair acceptance | Negative fixed effect, 95% CI excluding zero, **and** ≥ **20%** relative reduction in mean per-transition error | P§7.3 |
| Acceptance test | Linear mixed-effects on per-transition error; random intercepts for seed and episode-within-seed; episode-mean fallback | P§7.3 |
| H3 equivalence margin | **±5 percentage points** balanced accuracy | P§4.2 |
| Seeds — H1/H2 conditions (Exp 1, 2A, 2B) | **5** | P§14.2 |
| Seeds — canonical repair validation | **20** | P§7.3, P§14.2 |
| Seeds — configuration sweep & its repairs | **3** | P§14.2 |

| Failure threshold | Calibrated W4 Fri on a reference model, then **frozen permanently** | S§W4, P§10.1 |
| Compute escalation trigger | ≈ **120 GPU-hours** | P§14.3 |
| Balanced-accuracy weighting | **unit** — equal weight per configuration-condition; group-bootstrap intervals | D-044 |
| Confirmatory seed base | **1000** — every seed below it is pilot data, permanently excluded | D-034 |
| Stream version | **3** — separate validation and evaluation data streams | D-052 |
| Episode length | **10** steps | D-052 |
| Validation / evaluation pools | **40 / 100** complete episodes, fixed and shared | D-052 |
| Normalising scale | the **full movement evaluation pool**, measured **before any failure mask**, then reused for every subset, member and dataset size sharing that pool | D-061 |
| Bootstrap | **episode-level block bootstrap**, primary for H1/H2 | D-053 |
| Bootstrap sensitivities | transition-level and init-only: **W3 Fri pilot only**, never a verdict, not in the 8,197 | D-054 |
| Policy | adaptive counters **reset every episode**; overrides rejected on confirmatory seeds | D-051, D-054 |
| Reduction order when behind | catch-up day → ablations → full Exp 5 → configuration count (only to measured MDE) | S "When you fall behind" |
| **Seeds are not a reduction lever** | Withdrawn as an option in P v1.2 | P§14.3 |

## 3. Decisions ledger — *moved to its own file*

The records live in **`DECISIONS.md`** (D-037), append-only and complete.
Nothing is archived or condensed — the ledger simply outgrew this file's
500-line paste cap, and the cap is load-bearing: past it, nobody reads this.
The index below carries every id, so a decision cannot go missing from view.

**The student carries `PROJECT_STATE.md` *and* `DECISIONS.md` to Claude.**

## 4. Deviation log — *append-only · satisfies the schedule's mandated deviation log*

Anything not done as written, and why. **The schedule requires several of these to appear in the thesis methodology**: the reliability-gate rung reached, the PPO substitution, any repair-budget or configuration-count reduction, any cut experiment, and the W2 decision on whether the Experiment 2A conditions are drawn from the configuration sweep or are additional to it.

Format: `Week n Day | what was skipped or substituted | why | goes in methodology? yes/no`

### DEV-001 · Pre-start · Scripted exploratory policy replaces PPO
**Deviation:** PPO is replaced by a coverage-biased scripted exploratory policy with forced object interactions.
**Why:** P§13.2 permits the substitution and requires it to be recorded rather than hidden. PPO integration and tuning is one of the largest human-time sinks in the original Month 1, and the policy is explicitly not an object of study.
**Evidence required:** W2 Fri coverage metric over (shape, action) pairs; W2 Sat writes it into the methodology with the coverage figure.
**Goes in methodology:** **yes** — mandatory.

*(This deviation is inherited from the schedule document itself, which already made and justified it. Everything below this line is a live deviation, recorded as it happens.)*

### DEV-002 · Week 1 Mon–Wed run on 2026-08-15, two days early
**Deviation:** the Week 1 Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday cells were completed on Saturday 2026-08-15, before the 2026-08-17 start.
**Why:** all three are pure infrastructure — no compute consumed, no preregistered quantity touched, nothing that could bias a result. Doing them early converts Week 1's short days from typing into review, which is the scarcer resource now that implementation sits with Claude (see Q-004).
**Goes in methodology:** **no** — no bearing on any result.

### DEV-005 · 2026-08-15 · Three sessions reached Sol late
**Deviation:** the deltas for the environment build, the policy/collector build, and the Week 2 audit were not delivered to Sol at the time. Delta 8 was overwritten; the two following sessions produced no delta at all. All three are consolidated into delta 10.
**Why it is recorded rather than quietly fixed:** the schedule's deviation log exists so that decisions are not reconstructed from memory in Week 18, and a three-session gap in the review record is exactly the kind of thing that would otherwise vanish. Sol reviewed none of that work at the time it was done, so its review of delta 10 arrives after the code was built on — which is the verification lag Sol itself warned about.
**Goes in methodology:** **no** — process, not design. But it belongs in any honest account of how the review protocol actually ran.

### DEV-004 · 2026-08-15 · W2 Mon's confound parameter built during Week 1
**Deviation:** the confound-rate parameter (Schedule W2 Mon) and the three procedural layouts (W2 Tue) were implemented alongside the Week 1 Friday environment rather than in their scheduled cells.
**Why:** they are parameters *of* the generator. Building the generator without them and adding them two days later means writing it twice and risking drift between the config contract and what is actually generated. The W2 Mon acceptance criterion was run as specified and passes.
**Goes in methodology:** **no** — ordering only; no design change.

### DEV-006 · 2026-08-16 · Position-causal conditions are not canonical Experiment 2A
**Deviation:** the five canonical (causal attribute, layout) configurations cover shape and colour only. Position-causal conditions run in the three-seed configuration sweep as a declared robustness configuration, not as canonical Experiment 2A conditions.
**Why:** withholding position removes object *occupancy* rather than an attribute of a visible object — measured 37.5% aliased (observation, action) keys against 10.0% for shape and colour, with the key space 26× smaller. It is a different structural failure, and P§8.2.1's manipulation is about an unrepresentable rule. See D-026.
**Goes in methodology:** **yes** — it bounds what Experiment 2A's result is a result about, and the measurement behind it belongs with the claim.

### DEV-007 · 2026-08-16 · The primary error is agent position on movement transitions
**Deviation:** P§10.2's primary metric — held-out one-step prediction error, `E_t = ||s_{t+1} − f_θ(s_t, a_t)||` — is computed on the **next agent position only**, over **movement-action transitions only**, grid-normalised. Activation error is reported separately as a secondary metric; static components never enter the score.
**Why:** the plan leaves the dimension set of that norm unspecified, and averaging over all of them dilutes the manipulated mechanism ~15-fold and rescales it between families as the observation width changes with withholding. See D-032 for the measurements.
**Goes in methodology:** **yes** — it defines what every reported error number in the thesis means.

### DEV-003 · 2026-08-15 · venv created with `--system-site-packages`
**Deviation:** the virtual environment reuses the system torch/numpy/scipy/pandas rather than installing isolated copies.
**Why:** avoids re-downloading a CUDA-enabled torch. `pyproject.toml` pins every version, and every run record captures the resolved versions actually in use, so reproducibility is preserved. A fully isolated environment is available by dropping the flag.
**Goes in methodology:** **no** — but the pinned versions do appear in the reproducibility section.

## 5. Gate records

A gate is signed off in writing, with the verdict and the evidence behind it, on the day it falls. **Slip is absorbed by catch-up days, never by moving a gate.**

### Gate 1 — Week 5 Saturday, 2026-09-19 — *not yet reached*
Four conditions, all must hold:
1. Reliability gate passed with some estimator, **and the rung recorded** (rung 0 = default ensemble). If passed only at rung 3 or 4, H1 is recorded as **falsified for ensembles** and all downstream results are reported as a secondary path about that estimator.
2. Measured compute estimate within budget (timing harness, W4 Fri, against the ≈120 GPU-h trigger).
3. Permutation null shows the repair-acceptance test is calibrated (W5 Wed, 200 permutations).
4. MDE simulation shows the evaluation set can resolve a 5-point balanced-accuracy difference — computed on `min(N₀, N₁)`, not the total.

*Failure of condition 1 at every rung ⇒ pivot to a characterisation study of why uncertainty estimation is unreliable in this setting. That is a complete thesis, and the decision is made here, not in Month 4.*

### Gate 2 — Week 10 Saturday, 2026-10-24 — *not yet reached*
Two conditions:
1. Does the H2 signature reproduce across seeds? A pattern present in 3 runs out of 5 is reported as **unreliable**, not as a weak positive. If it does not reproduce, execute the pivot — decided here, not in Month 4.
2. Does the surviving per-class unit count still clear the Week 5 MDE requirement? If not, launch more configurations **now** — this is the last week where that is cheap.

## 6. Open questions

**For Sol** — questions Claude wants adversarially reviewed. Sol answers in verdict-block format; answered items move to §3 as decisions.

| # | Question | Raised | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| Q-001 | Is the Claude/Sol split in D-001 the right one, or does it under-use Sol? | 2026-08-13 | **Closed.** Sol: keep as written, high confidence. Would revisit if implementation or methodological decisions are repeatedly completed before Sol can review them — a standing tripwire, see §1 |
| Q-002 | Weeks 18–20 collide with Christmas / New Year; submission Friday is 2027-01-01. Shift or accept? | 2026-08-13 | **Closed** by student decision → D-004. Sol concurred |
| Q-003 | The W2 Wed confound double-booking. Same units or additional ones? | 2026-08-13 | **Closed** → D-007. Same units, run at higher seed count. Enumerator must dedupe by `unit_id` |
| Q-004 | Schedule capacity model now that Claude implements — hold dates, or compress? | 2026-08-15 | **Closed.** Sol agrees: hold every date and gate; spend the gain on review, understanding, documentation and prose, never scope. Names the failure mode as **verification lag** — implementation outrunning student and reviewer, leaving choices embedded in code before they are understood. Consequential methodological decisions must be *delivered before* dependent implementation proceeds; routine implementation need not wait |
| Q-005 | Should statistical identity be a registered field list rather than a schema hash? | 2026-08-15 | **Closed** → D-009. Sol: yes, explicit versioned identity list; `SCHEMA_VERSION` alone insufficient. Implemented in the stronger form Sol named — exhaustive classification, enforced at import, tested per field |
| Q-006 | Whitelist vs blacklist for the leakage firewall; and when to freeze it. | 2026-08-15 | **Closed** → D-013. Sol: whitelist, frozen before the Week 6 firewall is accepted, in a dedicated schema module rather than `constants.py`, with X / y / groups physically separate. Since P§13.5.1 fully specifies the features, Sol's "freeze it now" condition was met and it is frozen |
| Q-011 | Bootstrap granularity is not free for H1: disagreement is its dependent variable. | 2026-08-16 | **Closed** → D-053. Sol: episode-level block bootstrap is the fixed primary method; transition-level is a labelled secondary that may not overturn a verdict or be used to pick the friendlier curve; an initialisation-only ensemble is the better sensitivity because it isolates the source of disagreement |
| Q-010 | The auxiliary loss and the primary task share a trunk. | 2026-08-16 | **Closed** → D-047. Sol: detach the auxiliary head, make both losses action-conditional, remove the weighting knob. **My framing was wrong** — activation was 97.7% of the *loss* but only 16–36% of the *trunk gradient*; loss share is not gradient share |
| Q-009 | What does the world model predict, and is the failure threshold comparable across families? | 2026-08-16 | **Closed** → D-032 (dynamic components; primary error on agent position over movement transitions) and D-035 (one global threshold on a balanced reference pool) |
| Q-008 | Seed independence across units: shared environment streams at the same seed. | 2026-08-15 | **Closed** → D-030. Sol: named streams, independent across sweep units, but common random numbers preserved inside explicitly paired canonical comparisons via a preregistered `comparison_group_id`. `arm` never in the failure-set stream. **Decided, not yet built** — first Week 3 task |
| Q-007 | Plan/schedule contradiction on whether the no-statistics critic variant sees error history. | 2026-08-15 | **Closed** → D-029. Sol: P§12.1 and P§13.5.1 are internally inconsistent; keep the schema, rename the variant **"no explicit statistics"**, and tighten the W13 negative control to exclude `predicted_vs_actual_state` as well |

**For Claude** — things Sol or the student wants implemented, checked or measured.

| # | Item | Raised by | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| C-001 | File decisions for Q-007, Q-008, the fifteen-condition repair subset and class replenishment; correct the twenty-seed repair schedule and compute estimate; add cross-attribute transition-aliasing tests. Blocking for training, not for implementation | Sol, 2026-08-16 | **Done** → D-025 … D-031, `tests/test_aliasing.py` |
| C-002 | Build the D-030 named-stream module | Sol, 2026-08-16 | **Done** → `src/bu/streams.py`, `tests/test_streams.py` |
| C-004 | File the dynamic-target decision; correct the baseline accounting; mark inspected data as pilot; implement named streams; regenerate the Sol bundle | Sol, 2026-08-16 (delta 11) | **Done** → D-032 … D-036 |
| C-005 | Grouped dataset partitioning for the critic splitter — a comparison group never spans a split | Sol, 2026-08-16 (delta 12) | **Open** — key and report built (D-039); splitter is W6/W11 |
| C-006 | Week 5 MDE simulation: reproduce the **actual paired balanced-accuracy estimator** — real group sizes and class membership, group-preserving partitions, unit weights, paired critic-vs-baseline predictions, ICC grid — and validate against the analytic result at ICC = 0 **and** ICC = 1 | Sol, 2026-08-16 (deltas 12–14) | **Open** — fully specified in D-044; due W5 Thu |
| C-007 | Pass `require_confirmatory=True` in threshold calibration, repair acceptance and every critic loader as each is built | Sol, 2026-08-16 (delta 12) | **Open** — guard built (D-040); call sites are W4–W11 |
| C-008 | **Build the confirmatory runner**, which must own: episode bootstrap only, registered configuration and arm, matching pools and run identity, confirmatory seed policy, complete run records. `bootstrap_episodes()` + `train(train_index=…)` still bypasses the `train_ensemble` guard | Sol, 2026-08-16 (cert of 2875e60) | **Open** — blocks confirmatory execution and repair validation |
| C-009 | Runner hardening: reject `source_unit is None` in `assert_pools_match()` rather than ignoring it, and check each dataset's `stream_version` against the run's | Sol, 2026-08-16 | **Open** — non-blocking; current `collect_pools` output already satisfies both |
| C-003 | Predeclare the D-031 reserve draw order | Sol, 2026-08-16 | **Open** — due W5 Thu with the MDE simulation |
| C-010 | **W4 runner call-site invariants**, required tests: build the `NormalisationScale` from the full movement evaluation pool **before** the failure mask exists, and reuse **that object** for the whole-pool and masked statistics; and select **one immutable attempt** explicitly rather than loading a tree. Exact reproduction of the pilot does not validate the masked call site (D-064) | Sol, 2026-08-17 | **Open** — blocks W4 Fri |

## 7. Session log — *append-only, newest last*

Entries before this one are in `PROJECT_STATE_ARCHIVE.md`; 14 archived, 1 kept here.

### 2026-08-16 (W3 audit) · Seven defects, one of which moves a registered endpoint · Claude
**Did:** the Week 3 audit (D-060), on the precedent of D-015 and D-021 — a behavioural probe of everything built this week, before Week 4 builds a gate verdict on it. Nine Sol reviews are not a substitute: Sol reviews what is reported plus a diff, and cannot probe running code.
**Seven defects, three serious.** **W3-1** is the one that matters: P§10.3 requires per-dimension normalised error but never says *which set* defines the normalisation, and the scale was recomputed from whatever subset it was handed. Because the scale is a **vector** it does not cancel between the ratio's numerator and denominator — so the **registered H2 endpoint moves by up to 4.6%** with a choice nobody made, and the W4 Friday failure set is exactly such a subset. **W3-2**: the pilot bypassed `RunLogger` entirely, so its outputs had no commit, no dirty flag, no package versions, no `seed_partition` — P§13.7's requirement, using machinery Week 1 built for it. **W3-4**: `member_predictions` left every model in eval mode; inert for this MLP, but P§9.3 plans **MC-dropout** as reliability-gate fallback B2, and under it a model left in eval mode returns deterministic predictions with **zero disagreement** — which reads as "MC-dropout also fails H1" and triggers a false pivot at the gate the fallback exists for.
**Also:** the activation report used one member of five; `TrainConfig.val_fraction` was dead after D-052; `train_index` was unvalidated and **torch wraps negative indices silently**, so a bad resample would train on the wrong rows and fail later for an unrelated reason.
**Checked and correct**, which is half the point of an audit: checkpoint restoration on all three exit paths, patience counting, five members sharing no stream before or after training, member results independent of `ensemble_size`, nested prefixes still exact after the restructure, validation/evaluation byte-identical across sizes **and arms**, **zero** shared (obs, action) pairs between train and evaluation, passthrough correct for all five actions and row-wise on mixed batches, trunk isolated under `predict_next_obs`, the block bootstrap genuinely duplicating episodes, the partial minibatch used, no NaN anywhere, and 300 units / 150-150 / 8,197 fits unchanged.
**D-047's conditional is answered.** Across all five members and every dataset size the detached auxiliary head **never** beats its copy baseline — 0 of 3 seeds everywhere, best member 0.225 against 0.169, no improvement with data. Compute is not the obstacle (a second trunk is 1.98×, taking the design from ~1.6 to ~3.2 CPU-hours). **Recommendation: downgrade rather than spend it** — activation carries no hypothesis and P§10.2's primary error excludes it. Recorded for Sol, not decided.
**Result:** 413 → 418 tests, every finding with a named regression test. **Zero GPU-hours.**
**Next:** W4 Mon — the trend test, once Sol has ruled on W3-1's scale choice, which W4 consumes.
---

### 2026-08-17 (W3 closeout) · Two fixes that fixed the symptom, and a ruling on the scale · Claude
**Did:** Sol's review of deltas 27–28. D-059's interpretation corrections accepted; **`0b09f84` not certified**, and Week 3 not closed on two serious findings. Both verified before anything changed, per the standing rule, and **one of the two is different from how it was stated**.
**1. The MC-dropout fix did not fix MC-dropout.** Sol is exactly right: `member_predictions` restored `model.training` but still called `eval()` before the forward pass, so dropout was off *during* inference. Reproduced against the old path on a model with a real dropout layer — sample spread and mean pairwise disagreement both **exactly 0.000e+00**, against 0.298 and 0.547 under the replacement. Replaced with an explicit prediction policy, dropout re-activated per no-grad pass, modes restored per **submodule**, and **MC-dropout on a dropout-free model now raises** — `WorldModel` has none, so rung 3 is an explicit architectural choice rather than a silent zero.
**2. The rerun hazard is real, by a different route.** The append-with-restarting-counter mechanism is real at the class level (measured: ten records numbered 0–4, 0–4) but **unreachable** through `RunLogger.start`, which `write_run_record` rejects first — a same-scope rerun was refused *before writing anything*, files byte-identical. What is reachable is the same end state via a **different-scope** rerun: no `run_id` collision, so two executions' records and exports sat in one directory while `rows.json` described only the second. Fixed at three layers: `RunLogger` refuses to append (and continues the counter when told to), the pilot writes into a fresh `attempt-NNN` it never reopens, and `load_runs()` raises when one `run_id` appears in two directories.
**D-061 adopted as ruled.** The scale is measured once from the full movement evaluation pool before any mask. Enforced by construction: `NormalisationScale` is the only accepted argument and its only constructor reads a pool, so masking has nothing to recompute from. The **stale invariance claim is corrected in the artefacts** — it was in the module docstring and in a test's own docstring, not only in the ledger. **The pilot's numbers do not move:** a full rerun reproduces all four uncertainty fields at every size and seed, and all 90 member validation errors, exactly.
**D-063 adopted:** no second trunk; the head is a non-decisional diagnostic, and all four views are now reported per member with a **per-slice** copy baseline.
**Also found:** `runs/` and `figures/` are gitignored, so the evidence manifest Sol asked for **could never have reached a bundle**. The compact artefacts are now tracked by explicit exception; `manifest.json` + `rows.json` carry 18 runs × 5 member errors = 90 fits in 64 KB.
**Result:** 418 → 436 tests. **Zero GPU-hours** — the 90-fit rerun was CPU.
**Next:** deliver the closeout bundle. W4 Mon stays blocked until it passes review.

### 2026-08-17 (W3 micro-closeout) · A claim narrowed, and an isolation that only held on CPU · Claude
**Did:** Sol's review of delta 29. The substantive Week 3 corrections are **accepted** — D-061, D-063 and D-062's logging/attempt mechanism outright, and D-062's MC-dropout mechanism on CPU. All four of my questions were ruled on: the corrected rerun account accepted; the per-slice copy baseline accepted and preferred; the duplicate-`run_id` guard confirmed as belonging in `load_runs` **as defence in depth**, with the confirmatory runner additionally owing an explicit immutable-attempt selection; and exact reproduction accepted as valid evidence that D-061 **pins** the W3 numbers — but **not** as validation of the future masked call site. Two narrow items remained, both mine, neither requiring a rerun (D-064).
**1. "Enforced by construction" was too strong, and Sol is right.** `NormalisationScale`'s dataclass constructor is public, `from_evaluation_pool()` accepts a masked tensor, and the low-level metrics still take raw tensors. The true claim is narrower: the registered summary path **will not invent** a scale, so a subset cannot be normalised by accident — the rest is a **call-site invariant** the W4 runner must carry (C-010). Since it cannot be prevented at the type it is made auditable: a masked construction records the mask's size, and a test now asserts that (10, not 200) with a different vector. The old test's *name* claimed what its assertions did not, which is the D-055/D-057 defect in my own regression test.
**2. The RNG isolation was CPU-only.** `fork_rng(devices=[])` forks CPU always but device generators only for devices it is handed, so a GPU run advanced the CUDA generator — and the fallback estimator is the thing that would run on a GPU. Verified on this machine's device rather than reasoned about: under the old call `torch.cuda.get_rng_state()` was **not** preserved; under the fix it is, and the samples still vary. Devices are now derived from the model's parameters, buffers and inputs; two accelerator types raise; the CPU path is unchanged.
**Also, and it is the sharper lesson:** the bundle's own exclusion mechanism — built to keep the bundle reviewable — **excluded the evidence the bundle existed to deliver**. Sol could see digests and counters but not the 18 rows, the 90 validation errors or the per-member auxiliary values. A test passing on my machine is not evidence in the reviewer's hands. `rows.json` ships explicitly from now on.
**Result:** 436 → 440 tests. **Zero GPU-hours** of budget; one sub-second, ~68 MiB GPU test now runs where a device exists.
**Next:** deliver the micro-closeout. Sol expects to certify Week 3 on it, with no further scientific decision.

---

### 2026-08-17 (W3 RNG correction) · The seeding was wider than the fork · Claude
**Did:** Sol's review of delta 30. **Every scientific item is now accepted** — `rows.json` read and independently verified by Sol (18 rows, 18 unique run ids, 90 member errors, one scale vector per seed, reference counts 831/824/839, **0/90 wins over the copy baseline in all three activation slices**), the D-061 correction, C-010's formulation, D-063, device derivation, and the mixed-accelerator refusal. Certification held on one narrow code item, and Sol was right again (D-065).
**The leak.** D-064 fixed the *fork* to cover the devices in use and left the *seeding* on `torch.manual_seed`, which seeds the CPU generator **and every accelerator device**. The two sets stopped matching, so the call reseeded generators nothing would restore — including on a **CPU-only** call, where the computation never touches the GPU at all. Reproduced before changing anything: `torch.cuda.get_rng_state()` was not preserved across a pure-CPU MC-dropout call. Fixed by seeding device-locally — the CPU default generator directly, then each derived device — so the set seeded is exactly the set the fork restores.
**Why my own test missed it, which is the part to keep.** The CUDA test checked the one device that was both seeded *and* forked: the single configuration where the mismatch cancels. Written against the machine it ran on rather than against the claim. That is D-055/D-057's defect class arriving through **hardware** — a one-GPU machine cannot tell "seeds what it forks" from "seeds everything, forks one thing". The two-device test is written and **skips here**; it is declared unverified rather than reported as passing.
**Also:** `CLAUDE.md` still taught the next Claude the withdrawn "a mask has nothing to recompute from" model, in the file a reset Claude reads first. Corrected, with a pointer to C-010. The §7 entry carrying the old wording is **not** edited — §7 is append-only (D-014) and the entry after it withdraws the claim by name.
**Result:** 440 → 442 tests, 2 skipped. **Zero GPU-hours** of budget.
**Next:** deliver the RNG patch. Sol certifies Week 3 on it.

## 8. → TO SOL — *moved to its own file*

The delta Sol receives lives in **`DELTA_TO_SOL.md`** (D-023). It was moved out
because consolidating four sessions pushed this file past its 500-line paste
cap, and the two files have different audiences anyway: this one is Claude's
reconstruction of state, that one is Sol's feed.

It also removes an instruction that was easy to get wrong. "Paste §8" meant
scrolling to find a section boundary; "paste `DELTA_TO_SOL.md`" does not.

**Current status:** see the delivery flag at the top of `DELTA_TO_SOL.md`.
