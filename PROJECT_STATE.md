# PROJECT STATE — *Beyond Uncertainty*

**Bachelor's thesis · Diagnosing When Embodied World Models Need More Data or a Different Model**

This is the single shared working file for the project. It is written by Claude, reviewed by Sol, and carried between sessions by the student. If a fact about this project is not in this file, it does not survive the end of a Claude session.

**The memory asymmetry — read this before anything else.** Sol runs in one continuous session and never forgets. Claude is closed and reopened repeatedly and starts each session blank. This file exists primarily so **Claude can reconstruct** what Sol simply remembers. Two consequences:

- Claude reads this file **first, in full**, at the start of every session — before touching code, before answering anything.
- Sol is **not** re-fed the whole file each time. Sol gets `DELTA_TO_SOL.md`. Re-pasting everything wastes the student's effort and buries new information in text Sol already has.

**Corollary — Sol is the continuity check on Claude.** If Claude returns after a reset and contradicts something settled weeks ago, Sol is the one who will notice. That is a real duty, not a courtesy.

**Paste rule.** This file must stay small enough to paste into a chat window. Target ≤ 500 lines. When §7 grows past that, move closed phases to `PROJECT_STATE_ARCHIVE.md` and leave a one-line pointer. Never let this file become the thing nobody reads.

**Source of truth.** The two plan documents are authoritative for *design*; this file is authoritative for *state*. Where they conflict on design, the plan wins and the conflict goes in §4 as a deviation. This file never silently overrides the plan.

- Claude's operational handoff, read first at session start: `CLAUDE.md`
- Plan: `docs/thesis_project_plan_v1_2.docx` (v1.2, design frozen) — cited below as **P§n**
- Schedule: `docs/thesis_day_by_day_schedule_v1_2.docx` (v1.2, 20 weeks) — cited below as **S§Wn**

## 0. How to use this file

**Claude — session start.** Before anything else, including for a question that looks trivial: read this file in full (§1 where you are, §2 what you may not change, §3–§5 what past-you decided); check §1's *Last updated* against today and say so if it is over a week stale — a stale snapshot is how a reset agent confidently redoes finished work; check §6 for anything Sol asked for that is unactioned; then tell the student in two lines where things stand and what you think is next, and wait.

**Claude — session end.** (1) Rewrite §1 so it is true now. (2) Append a §7 session-log entry. (3) Append any new §3 decisions, §4 deviations, §5 gate records. (4) Update `DELTA_TO_SOL.md` — append if undelivered, replace only once delivered (D-008, D-023), naming the session under `COVERS SESSIONS`; it is the only channel through which Sol learns anything. (5) Run the suite: `tests/test_project_state.py` enforces (1)–(4) mechanically (D-022), and if it fails, **fix the file, not the test**. From the first real result onward every delta reporting one carries a `NUMBERS` block (D-011): unit counts including `min(N₀, N₁)`, seeds and policy, point estimate, interval *and what it was taken over*, ambiguous and undiagnosed counts, and which test ran — prose alone leaves Sol unable to audit anything, which is the same as having no reviewer.

**Never edit a past entry in §3, §4, §5 or §7.** Corrections are new entries referencing the old one. §1 and §8 are the only sections that get overwritten.

**Sol.** Onboarded once with `SOL_BRIEF.md` and this file in full, then continuous; thereafter receives only `DELTA_TO_SOL.md`. Returns verdict blocks in the brief's format and does not rewrite this file — the student pastes them back and Claude files them into §6 or §3. If Sol's session is ever lost, re-onboard with `SOL_BRIEF.md` + this whole file, saying explicitly that it follows a session loss.

**Student.** To Sol: `DELTA_TO_SOL.md` only (first time or after a Sol session loss: `SOL_BRIEF.md` + this whole file). To Claude: the whole file at every session start, then Sol's verdict blocks as they arrive. Keep this file in version control so its own history is diffable.

**Hypothesis status**

| | Claim | Status | Decided at |
|---|---|---|---|
| H1 | Ensemble disagreement tracks estimation failure | Not tested | Gate check W4, verdict W10 Mon |
| H2 | Disagreement-to-error ratio is low under hypothesis-class failure | Not tested | W10 Tue → **Gate 2** |
| H3 | Learned critic beats fitted (error, disagreement) rule by > 5 pts | Not tested | W15 Fri |

**Done — Weeks 1 and 2, every "Done when" criterion verified rather than asserted.**
Detail is in `PROJECT_STATE_ARCHIVE.md` §7 and in the decisions below.
- **Week 1** — repo, `constants.py` (D-005), config and three identities (D-006), run records, JSONL logging, gridworld, masking encoder. Audited: seven defects (D-015), version bump under a Change Record (D-016).
- **Week 2** — confound parameter, enumerator (D-018), scripted policy and collector with coverage evidence (D-020), both prose cells drafted (D-019, awaiting the student's rewrite). Audited: six defects (D-021).
- **Sol's earlier rulings implemented** — identity registry (D-009), `stage` in run identity (D-012), critic whitelist frozen (D-013).
- **All five of Sol's 2026-08-16 reviews actioned in full** (D-025 … D-045). All five verdicts were CHALLENGED; every finding was independently verified before anything changed, and every one stood. The second found 375 fits of phantom compute. The fourth and fifth were both about **my reasoning rather than the code**, on the same paragraph: a worst-case bound reported as a measurement (D-042), then two different estimands compared as if one approximated the other (D-044).
- **D-030's named streams are built** (`src/bu/streams.py`), verified on the pairing properties rather than merely present: Experiment 1's datasets are nested prefixes, 2A/2B levels share a group, units in **different comparison groups** are independent at equal seeds — units inside one group are correlated by design (D-039, corrected by D-042 and D-044). `arm` never affects stream identity; raw `stage` is absent from a key but can reach data-stream *derivation* via `comparison_stage`, which is why `execution_plan` verifies that every role merged into one fit resolves to identical streams (D-038).

**In flight:** nothing running. **No compute consumed.**

**Next actions — Week 3, the world model.**
0. **W3 Mon — DONE and Sol-ruled** (D-046, D-047, D-048). Criterion met across all five capacity levels and all four withholding configurations. Beyond it: blocked movement transitions carry **1.67×** the position error of free moves; `interact` is deterministic and predictable in every canonical condition (0 aliased successors) but aliased when position is withheld — a second mechanism behind D-026.
1. **W3 Tue — DONE** (D-049). Trains 5,000 transitions, early-stops at epoch 10 of 31 in 1.5s CPU, curve reaching `load_runs()`. Split by episode and **strided**, all of D-047's constraints implemented. Measured: a transition-level split is **4.5–8.7× optimistic**, worst at small n.
2. **W3 Wed — NEXT** — bootstrap resampling and K-member ensemble trainer, drawing from the `bootstrap`, `init` and `batch` streams. *Done when: five members train, per-member validation error logged.* Carries the open item below.

**No open questions.** Q-010 closed by D-047: the auxiliary head is detached, both losses are action-conditional, and three unrecorded result-affecting knobs are gone. Position loss improved 0.002242 → 0.000931 at the same budget. **One open item carried into W3 Tue:** the detached head sits at 0.2575 against a copy baseline of 0.1652 after 3,000 epochs, and Sol's conditional for a second trunk turns on whether the real training loop can close that — it must not be decided from a hand-rolled loop.

**Blocked on:** nothing for Week 3. Sol permits MLP implementation and development training. Still blocked, by Sol and correctly: **confirmatory collection** and **critic splitting / Week 5 MDE approval** — see C-003, C-005, C-006. No open questions.

**Standing watch — Sol's tripwire on D-001.** Sol endorsed the role split conditionally, and DEV-005 was a hit against that condition. Sol weighed it on 2026-08-16 and **kept the split**, on the grounds that the mechanised protocol tests improve the arrangement more than reassigning implementation would. The watch stays live: consequential design decisions go into a delta **and get delivered** before dependent code is built on them, and Claude flags any decision it believes meets that bar at the moment of making it. D-030 is the current test of that — decided, filed, and deliberately left unbuilt.

## 2. Frozen constants — *changing any of these requires a §3 Change Record and a Sol review*

These are the preregistered quantities. They are fixed **before** data collection and are not revised after seeing data. Their whole purpose is to be un-adjustable later.

| Constant | Value | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Data-repair budget | **10×** the failure-condition dataset, same generating process | P§7.2 |
| Repair acceptance | Negative fixed effect, 95% CI excluding zero, **and** ≥ **20%** relative reduction in mean per-transition error | P§7.3 |
| Acceptance test | Linear mixed-effects on per-transition error; random intercepts for seed and episode-within-seed; episode-mean fallback | P§7.3 |
| H3 equivalence margin | **±5 percentage points** balanced accuracy | P§4.2 |
| Seeds — H1/H2 conditions (Exp 1, 2A, 2B) | **5** | P§14.2 |
| Seeds — canonical repair validation | **20** | P§7.3, P§14.2 |
| Seeds — configuration sweep & its repairs | **3** | P§14.2 |
| Seeds — ablations | **5** | P§14.2 |
| Labelled configuration-conditions | ≥ **300**, ≥ **60** held out | P§10.7 |
| Statistical unit | The **configuration-condition** — throughout | P§10.7 |
| Failure threshold | Calibrated W4 Fri on a reference model, then **frozen permanently** | S§W4, P§10.1 |
| Compute escalation trigger | ≈ **120 GPU-hours** | P§14.3 |
| Balanced-accuracy weighting | **unit** — equal weight per configuration-condition; group-bootstrap intervals | D-044 |
| Confirmatory seed base | **1000** — every seed below it is pilot data, permanently excluded | D-034 |
| Stream version | **2** — `batch` added to the named purposes | D-049 |
| Reduction order when behind | catch-up day → ablations → full Exp 5 → configuration count (only to measured MDE) | S "When you fall behind" |
| **Seeds are not a reduction lever** | Withdrawn as an option in P v1.2 | P§14.3 |

**Calendar anchors** (Week 1 Monday = 2026-08-17)

| Milestone | Date |
|---|---|
| Week 1 Mon — start | 2026-08-17 |

## 3. Decisions ledger — *moved to its own file*

The records live in **`DECISIONS.md`** (D-037), append-only and complete.
Nothing is archived or condensed — the ledger simply outgrew this file's
500-line paste cap, and the cap is load-bearing: past it, nobody reads this.
The index below carries every id, so a decision cannot go missing from view.

**The student carries `PROJECT_STATE.md` *and* `DECISIONS.md` to Claude.**

## 4. Deviation log — *append-only · satisfies the schedule's mandated deviation log*

Anything not done as written, and why. **The schedule requires several of these to appear in the thesis methodology**: the reliability-gate rung reached, the PPO substitution, any repair-budget or configuration-count reduction, any cut experiment, and the W2 decision on whether the Experiment 2A conditions are drawn from the configuration sweep or are additional to it.

Format: `Week n Day | what was skipped or substituted | why | goes in methodology? yes/no`

### DEV-001 · Pre-start · Scripted exploratory policy replaces PPO
**Deviation:** PPO is replaced by a coverage-biased scripted exploratory policy with forced object interactions.
**Why:** P§13.2 permits the substitution and requires it to be recorded rather than hidden. PPO integration and tuning is one of the largest human-time sinks in the original Month 1, and the policy is explicitly not an object of study.
**Evidence required:** W2 Fri coverage metric over (shape, action) pairs; W2 Sat writes it into the methodology with the coverage figure.
**Goes in methodology:** **yes** — mandatory.

*(This deviation is inherited from the schedule document itself, which already made and justified it. Everything below this line is a live deviation, recorded as it happens.)*

### DEV-002 · Week 1 Mon–Wed run on 2026-08-15, two days early
**Deviation:** the Week 1 Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday cells were completed on Saturday 2026-08-15, before the 2026-08-17 start.
**Why:** all three are pure infrastructure — no compute consumed, no preregistered quantity touched, nothing that could bias a result. Doing them early converts Week 1's short days from typing into review, which is the scarcer resource now that implementation sits with Claude (see Q-004).
**Goes in methodology:** **no** — no bearing on any result.

### DEV-005 · 2026-08-15 · Three sessions reached Sol late
**Deviation:** the deltas for the environment build, the policy/collector build, and the Week 2 audit were not delivered to Sol at the time. Delta 8 was overwritten; the two following sessions produced no delta at all. All three are consolidated into delta 10.
**Why it is recorded rather than quietly fixed:** the schedule's deviation log exists so that decisions are not reconstructed from memory in Week 18, and a three-session gap in the review record is exactly the kind of thing that would otherwise vanish. Sol reviewed none of that work at the time it was done, so its review of delta 10 arrives after the code was built on — which is the verification lag Sol itself warned about.
**Goes in methodology:** **no** — process, not design. But it belongs in any honest account of how the review protocol actually ran.

### DEV-004 · 2026-08-15 · W2 Mon's confound parameter built during Week 1
**Deviation:** the confound-rate parameter (Schedule W2 Mon) and the three procedural layouts (W2 Tue) were implemented alongside the Week 1 Friday environment rather than in their scheduled cells.
**Why:** they are parameters *of* the generator. Building the generator without them and adding them two days later means writing it twice and risking drift between the config contract and what is actually generated. The W2 Mon acceptance criterion was run as specified and passes.
**Goes in methodology:** **no** — ordering only; no design change.

### DEV-006 · 2026-08-16 · Position-causal conditions are not canonical Experiment 2A
**Deviation:** the five canonical (causal attribute, layout) configurations cover shape and colour only. Position-causal conditions run in the three-seed configuration sweep as a declared robustness configuration, not as canonical Experiment 2A conditions.
**Why:** withholding position removes object *occupancy* rather than an attribute of a visible object — measured 37.5% aliased (observation, action) keys against 10.0% for shape and colour, with the key space 26× smaller. It is a different structural failure, and P§8.2.1's manipulation is about an unrepresentable rule. See D-026.
**Goes in methodology:** **yes** — it bounds what Experiment 2A's result is a result about, and the measurement behind it belongs with the claim.

### DEV-007 · 2026-08-16 · The primary error is agent position on movement transitions
**Deviation:** P§10.2's primary metric — held-out one-step prediction error, `E_t = ||s_{t+1} − f_θ(s_t, a_t)||` — is computed on the **next agent position only**, over **movement-action transitions only**, grid-normalised. Activation error is reported separately as a secondary metric; static components never enter the score.
**Why:** the plan leaves the dimension set of that norm unspecified, and averaging over all of them dilutes the manipulated mechanism ~15-fold and rescales it between families as the observation width changes with withholding. See D-032 for the measurements.
**Goes in methodology:** **yes** — it defines what every reported error number in the thesis means.

### DEV-003 · 2026-08-15 · venv created with `--system-site-packages`
**Deviation:** the virtual environment reuses the system torch/numpy/scipy/pandas rather than installing isolated copies.
**Why:** avoids re-downloading a CUDA-enabled torch. `pyproject.toml` pins every version, and every run record captures the resolved versions actually in use, so reproducibility is preserved. A fully isolated environment is available by dropping the flag.
**Goes in methodology:** **no** — but the pinned versions do appear in the reproducibility section.

---

## 5. Gate records

A gate is signed off in writing, with the verdict and the evidence behind it, on the day it falls. **Slip is absorbed by catch-up days, never by moving a gate.**

### Gate 1 — Week 5 Saturday, 2026-09-19 — *not yet reached*
Four conditions, all must hold:
1. Reliability gate passed with some estimator, **and the rung recorded** (rung 0 = default ensemble). If passed only at rung 3 or 4, H1 is recorded as **falsified for ensembles** and all downstream results are reported as a secondary path about that estimator.
2. Measured compute estimate within budget (timing harness, W4 Fri, against the ≈120 GPU-h trigger).
3. Permutation null shows the repair-acceptance test is calibrated (W5 Wed, 200 permutations).
4. MDE simulation shows the evaluation set can resolve a 5-point balanced-accuracy difference — computed on `min(N₀, N₁)`, not the total.

*Failure of condition 1 at every rung ⇒ pivot to a characterisation study of why uncertainty estimation is unreliable in this setting. That is a complete thesis, and the decision is made here, not in Month 4.*

### Gate 2 — Week 10 Saturday, 2026-10-24 — *not yet reached*
Two conditions:
1. Does the H2 signature reproduce across seeds? A pattern present in 3 runs out of 5 is reported as **unreliable**, not as a weak positive. If it does not reproduce, execute the pivot — decided here, not in Month 4.
2. Does the surviving per-class unit count still clear the Week 5 MDE requirement? If not, launch more configurations **now** — this is the last week where that is cheap.

## 6. Open questions

**For Sol** — questions Claude wants adversarially reviewed. Sol answers in verdict-block format; answered items move to §3 as decisions.

| # | Question | Raised | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| Q-001 | Is the Claude/Sol split in D-001 the right one, or does it under-use Sol? | 2026-08-13 | **Closed.** Sol: keep as written, high confidence. Would revisit if implementation or methodological decisions are repeatedly completed before Sol can review them — a standing tripwire, see §1 |
| Q-002 | Weeks 18–20 collide with Christmas / New Year; submission Friday is 2027-01-01. Shift or accept? | 2026-08-13 | **Closed** by student decision → D-004. Sol concurred |
| Q-003 | The W2 Wed confound double-booking. Same units or additional ones? | 2026-08-13 | **Closed** → D-007. Same units, run at higher seed count. Enumerator must dedupe by `unit_id` |
| Q-004 | Schedule capacity model now that Claude implements — hold dates, or compress? | 2026-08-15 | **Closed.** Sol agrees: hold every date and gate; spend the gain on review, understanding, documentation and prose, never scope. Names the failure mode as **verification lag** — implementation outrunning student and reviewer, leaving choices embedded in code before they are understood. Consequential methodological decisions must be *delivered before* dependent implementation proceeds; routine implementation need not wait |
| Q-005 | Should statistical identity be a registered field list rather than a schema hash? | 2026-08-15 | **Closed** → D-009. Sol: yes, explicit versioned identity list; `SCHEMA_VERSION` alone insufficient. Implemented in the stronger form Sol named — exhaustive classification, enforced at import, tested per field |
| Q-006 | Whitelist vs blacklist for the leakage firewall; and when to freeze it. | 2026-08-15 | **Closed** → D-013. Sol: whitelist, frozen before the Week 6 firewall is accepted, in a dedicated schema module rather than `constants.py`, with X / y / groups physically separate. Since P§13.5.1 fully specifies the features, Sol's "freeze it now" condition was met and it is frozen |
| Q-010 | The auxiliary loss and the primary task share a trunk. | 2026-08-16 | **Closed** → D-047. Sol: detach the auxiliary head, make both losses action-conditional, remove the weighting knob. **My framing was wrong** — activation was 97.7% of the *loss* but only 16–36% of the *trunk gradient*; loss share is not gradient share |
| Q-009 | What does the world model predict, and is the failure threshold comparable across families? | 2026-08-16 | **Closed** → D-032 (dynamic components; primary error on agent position over movement transitions) and D-035 (one global threshold on a balanced reference pool) |
| Q-008 | Seed independence across units: shared environment streams at the same seed. | 2026-08-15 | **Closed** → D-030. Sol: named streams, independent across sweep units, but common random numbers preserved inside explicitly paired canonical comparisons via a preregistered `comparison_group_id`. `arm` never in the failure-set stream. **Decided, not yet built** — first Week 3 task |
| Q-007 | Plan/schedule contradiction on whether the no-statistics critic variant sees error history. | 2026-08-15 | **Closed** → D-029. Sol: P§12.1 and P§13.5.1 are internally inconsistent; keep the schema, rename the variant **"no explicit statistics"**, and tighten the W13 negative control to exclude `predicted_vs_actual_state` as well |

**For Claude** — things Sol or the student wants implemented, checked or measured.

| # | Item | Raised by | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| C-001 | File decisions for Q-007, Q-008, the fifteen-condition repair subset and class replenishment; correct the twenty-seed repair schedule and compute estimate; add cross-attribute transition-aliasing tests. Blocking for training, not for implementation | Sol, 2026-08-16 | **Done** → D-025 … D-031, `tests/test_aliasing.py` |
| C-002 | Build the D-030 named-stream module | Sol, 2026-08-16 | **Done** → `src/bu/streams.py`, `tests/test_streams.py` |
| C-004 | File the dynamic-target decision; correct the baseline accounting; mark inspected data as pilot; implement named streams; regenerate the Sol bundle | Sol, 2026-08-16 (delta 11) | **Done** → D-032 … D-036 |
| C-005 | Grouped dataset partitioning for the critic splitter — a comparison group never spans a split | Sol, 2026-08-16 (delta 12) | **Open** — key and report built (D-039); splitter is W6/W11 |
| C-006 | Week 5 MDE simulation: reproduce the **actual paired balanced-accuracy estimator** — real group sizes and class membership, group-preserving partitions, unit weights, paired critic-vs-baseline predictions, ICC grid — and validate against the analytic result at ICC = 0 **and** ICC = 1 | Sol, 2026-08-16 (deltas 12–14) | **Open** — fully specified in D-044; due W5 Thu |

## 7. Session log — *append-only, newest last*

Entries before this one are in `PROJECT_STATE_ARCHIVE.md`; 14 archived, 1 kept here.

### 2026-08-16 (W3 Tue) · The training loop, and how leaky a transition split is · Claude
**Did:** built `src/bu/models/train.py` (D-049) — episode-level strided split, early stopping on the movement-position validation loss alone, best checkpoint restored, both loss terms logged per epoch, no gradient clipping, minibatch order from a new named `batch` stream. All seven of D-047's training-loop constraints implemented. Change Record: `STREAM_VERSION` 1 → 2.
**Result:** 313 → 331 tests. Criterion met: 5,000 transitions, early stop at epoch 10 of 31, 1.5s on CPU, curve reaching `load_runs()` as one record per epoch.
**The measurement that justifies the split, run rather than argued:** a transition-level split reports validation loss **4.5–8.7× lower on the same data** (0.00144 vs 0.01250 at n=250; 0.00075 vs 0.00338 at n=5000), and **the optimism is worst at small n**. That is the direction that corrupts Experiment 1 specifically — the error-versus-data curve would flatten at the small-data end and estimation failure would appear in the wrong place. The leaky split also ran 237 epochs against 27, because it kept improving on data it had already seen.
**Second measurement, which decided strided over contiguous:** the scripted policy carries coverage counters across episodes, so it drifts — over 100 episodes the moved-transition fraction falls 0.543 → 0.476 and the action distribution shifts. A tail split would hold out a distribution the model never trained on. Striding also keeps held-out episodes identical across nested-prefix datasets, so a data-size sweep is not also a held-out-set sweep.
**Compute:** CPU only, seconds. GPU untouched at the student's request — it was at 14.1/16.4 GB under another workload. **Zero GPU-hours consumed.**
**Next:** W3 Wed — the bootstrap ensemble. Carries D-047's open item: whether the detached auxiliary head can beat its copy baseline under a real training loop.

## 8. → TO SOL — *moved to its own file*

The delta Sol receives lives in **`DELTA_TO_SOL.md`** (D-023). It was moved out
because consolidating four sessions pushed this file past its 500-line paste
cap, and the two files have different audiences anyway: this one is Claude's
reconstruction of state, that one is Sol's feed.

It also removes an instruction that was easy to get wrong. "Paste §8" meant
scrolling to find a section boundary; "paste `DELTA_TO_SOL.md`" does not.

**Current status:** see the delivery flag at the top of `DELTA_TO_SOL.md`.
